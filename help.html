		<h2>Features:</h2>
		<br>- Monitors Clipboard and automatically adds copied YouTube links to a list of videos "to be played"
		<br>- Autoplays queued videos (can be disabled in "queue" list)
		<br>- Saves list of unplayed videos for you so you can get right back where you were before leaving
		<br>- Saves current video progress (requires 3rd party cookies to be enabled)
		<br>- Discord RPC integration - Shows what you're watching (can be disabled in settings)

		<h2>Limitations:</h2>
		<br>- The CustomPlayer uses Youtube Embed Player, so some videos might not be able to be played (this is up to the creator to decide)
		<br>- For the same reason, no Ads will play as Google can't guarantee the validity of the advertisement to the advertisers.
		<br>- Age restricted videos will not play either unless 3rd party cookies are enabled. That <i>might</i> solve this issue, as it allows the player to check for the account you're currently logged in on Youtube.com. You can check if it worked by right-clicking the player > "Account"
		<br>- Some users also reported that some AdBlocking extensions <i>might</i> block traffic to google. If the site doesn't work, try disabling your AdBlock for the player's site (ads should not play either way)

		<h2>Usage:</h2>
		<br>1) Open the <a href="https://ytb.dmcroww.tech">custom player</a> in your browser
		<br>2) Go to <a href="https://youtube.com">Youtube</a> and <strong>copy a video link</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Right click on video > <em>Copy link address</em>, or click the three dots > <em>Share</em> > <em>Copy link</em>.</li>
			<li><strong>Manual mode</strong>:
				<br>- On the Player page, paste your link in the input field at the top of the queue list (left side of screen).
			</li>
			<li><strong>Automated mode</strong>:
				<br>- Local script will recognize the link, and send it through WebSocket to the player.
				<ul>
					<li>If sounds are enabled in settings, you should hear a <em>ding</em> sound after copying the link.</li>
					<li>You can keep adding more videos. They'll be put in a queue.</li>
					<li>Duplicate videos won't be added.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		3) Video should be added
		<ul>
			<li>If the link was valid, there should be a new entry in the queue list.</li>
			<li>If the queue list was empty and <strong>autoplay</strong> is enabled, the player will play the video right away.</li>
		</ul>
		4) Enjoy YouTube without being blocked or slowed down for using AdBlock.
		<br>5) <i>optional</i> Enable 3rd party cookies
		<br> - For enhanced features like history and playback resuming, enable 3rd party cookies if you have them disabled.

		<h2>Automated mode (local script) Installation:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Make sure you have Node.js installed and up-to-date</b></li>
